Inspirational Thoughts From a Man Slowly Drifting to Nowhere

## Introduction
This software follows the progress of a man named Rimas. He has a device called a DeLorme inReach on his sailboat, and can send simple messages as he drifts around. The messages are made available in a JSON file from DeLorme (now Garmin), and Rimas Adrift parses it, displays the messages in an easy-to-read format, draws a map, and does some calculations of distance, heading, and speed.

## Built With
